LAB: The Trivia Website Leaderboard
Lesson Time: 60 Minutes

In this lab, you will use List and ForEach loops to practice working with collections.

Scenario:
You work for a company that runs a trivia web site. Users of the site compete by answering trivia 
questions to get the best score possible. One of the features of the site is that users are able 
to see a list of high scores.

You’ve been asked to use C# to create the score leaderboard logic. You work for a large team, 
so someone else will worry about getting it to display on the page, your task is to implement the code logic.

You’ve been given these scores to work with.
Score
4400
8900
1200
3700
7200

Using C# lists, do the following.
1. Create a list that holds the scores you’ve been given.

2. Sort the scores lowest to highest and output to the screen.

3. Sort the scores highest to lowest and output to the screen.

4. You’ve just been given a new score that wasn’t part of the original list. Add the score 2400 to the list.

5. A user has closed their account and needs to have all of their information deleted. 
   Remove the score 4400 from the list.
